## Quick Start

Get Docker for free from the [Docker Store](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download).
This app will work with versions from either the Stable or the Edge channels.

> If you're using [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) on Windows 10 pro or later, you must also switch to [Linux containers](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#switch-between-windows-and-linux-containers).

Run in this directory:

    $ docker-compose up

You can test it with the `voter` CLI
```
$ docker run -it --rm --network=host subfuzion/voter vote
? What do you like better? (Use arrow keys)
  (quit)
❯ cats
  dogs
```

You can print voting results:

```
$ docker run -it --rm --network=host subfuzion/voter results
Total votes -> cats: 4, dogs: 0 ... CATS WIN!
```

When you are finished:

Press `Ctrl-C` to stop the stack, then enter:

    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml rm -f

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes and Helm chart support has been added to the repo (under `kubernetes` directory).

### Amazon ECS with Fargate
